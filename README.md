Changed speed from 3 to 7

Changed gravity to -5f

Changed jumpSpeed to 30

Changing these three values made the players move and turn more quickly, which made playing less frustrating.

I added coin collection as a new goal for the game. Each platform has a coin that both players can collect to earn more points.

Changing the move speed and adding coins pressures the players to collect coins before their opponent does, which makes the game more competitve and exciting.
