Changed speed from 3 to 7

Changed gravity to -5f

Changed jumpSpeed to 30

Changing these three values made the players move and turn more quickly, which made playing less frustrating.

I added coin collection as a new goal for the game. Each platform has a coin that both players can collect to earn more points.

Changing the move speed and adding coins pressures the players to collect coins before their opponent does, which makes the game more competitve and exciting. 


Unity 6

Added UI point scoring, set win value to 5 and displayed win text when win value is met.

Unity 7

Added a few boxes that players can push around in order to jump to higher platforms.
Already added a coin system previously, hooked it up to the inventory system.
Created the managers and inventory system.


Unity 8
Removed the leap frog point system and changed the win condition to be whichever player collects the most coins. There are two players and 15 coins, so the first player to collect 8 coins wins. This makes for a fun, fast-paced racing game that takes under a minute to complete.
